# store-buddy

This package is currently under development, but Jest is acting strange. If you are here because of the issues I've made then any help would be much appreciated and you will be credited for it.

To help out, clone the repo, run `npm install` and then make Jest able to run without the TS2307 error ("Cannot find module 'store-buddy' or its corresponding type declarations"). I don't care if the tests themselves fail, just that they are able to run.

Good luck and godspeed. The license is MIT.
